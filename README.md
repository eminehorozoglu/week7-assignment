Reflections:

 1- I had no problems writing and reading data to the SQL table. The only problem I had was that when I pulled the data from the SQL table, the date format was different and I could not convert it in Java. So I changed the column value of the table to varchar instead of date.

 2- I tried the delete page using the param value but I couldn't get the code to work. Instead, I asked the user for the value to be deleted and performed the delete operation using that value.

 3- Since we could not determine the home page at the first launch, the pages were appearing one inside the other. As a result of my research on the internet, I found the Route index element code and used it for the home page.
